#### Description

Rex, a robot who navigates the intersection between humanity and a mechanical being, navigates building relationships, showing integrity and self-awareness while navigating lifeâ€™s challenges in a dystopian future.

This will be a world first built within the mind and imagination, then with pixelated paint atoms and finally with pure light pixels as conveyed by electrons and movement as harnessed by those electrons. From the ethereal, to the real, and then somewhere in the middle where they intersect. The story will use the canvas of the imagination, playa, screen, and mechanical movement.
